# Lexer language COOL

This repository implements a lexer (read the code ant split it in tokens) for the language COOL (Classroom Object Oriented Programming).

The code " main.c " is inside the folder ' lexer ', and in the root are some files to test the resuts with the correct expression.

To run the lexer, just type ' make '.
